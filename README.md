# Command_DesignPattern

It's a very simple implementation of Command Desing Pattern that I got me very interested in itself after reading about it recently in 
Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C# (Robert C. Martin).

.Net Framework 4.7.1 Console Application.

Hungarian notation (_privateProperty) used, since it's required from me in my recent project in work. 
(Just trying to stick to the convension used in a very old project)
